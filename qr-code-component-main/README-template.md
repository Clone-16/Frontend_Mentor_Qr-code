## Overview

I built a clean, responsive QR code display page using only HTML and CSS. The main goal was to create a realistic-looking QR code without relying on images or external libraries — everything was hand-crafted using pure CSS.

## My process

Research & Planning
Studied real QR code structure (finder patterns at 3 corners, timing patterns, data modules).
HTML Structure
Created a container
CSS Grid Layout
Used display: grid with fixed rows/columns to arrange all modules perfectly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-Advanced CSS Grid and Flexbox for precise pixel placement
-How real QR codes are structured (finder patterns, alignment, data modules)
-Creating complex designs without images or JavaScript
-Clean, maintainable CSS using variables and proper naming
-Responsive design principles

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: var();
}
```

### Continued development

i would love to keep working more on projects and assessing myself everywhere
